## DOM Manipulation

### Description
This project demonstrates my proficiency in **Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation**. The main objective is to dynamically update the content and structure of a webpage using JavaScript. Key features include:

- **Dynamic Content Creation:** Add, modify, and remove elements on the page.
- **Event Handling:** Manage user interactions through events such as clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.
- **Real-time Updates:** Reflect changes on the webpage without reloading, enhancing the user experience.

## Playwright Tests

### Description
This project includes a suite of automated tests using Playwright, a powerful end-to-end testing framework. The tests are designed to validate the functionality and performance of web applications across different browsers.

- Cross-browser Testing: Ensure that your application behaves consistently across Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit.
- Headless Testing: Execute tests in a headless environment for faster and more efficient test runs.
- Advanced Test Scenarios: Cover complex user interactions, navigation, and input validation.
  
## QUnit Tests

### Description
In this project, I have used QUnit, a JavaScript unit testing framework, to write and execute unit tests. The goal is to ensure that individual units of code (such as functions) work as expected.

- Test Suites: Organize tests into suites for modular testing.
- Assertions: Utilize a variety of assertions to validate code functionality.
- Test Coverage: Achieve high test coverage by thoroughly testing all critical code paths.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A web browser (e.g., [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/))

## Usage

### Running the DOM Manipulation Project
Open `index.html` in your browser to see the DOM manipulation in action.

### Running Playwright Tests
Execute the Playwright test suite with the following command:

```
npx playwright test
```

### Running QUnit Tests
Simply open the `test/index.html` file in your browser to run the tests.
